ðŸ“š What is Debouncing?

Debouncing is a technique used in programming to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often. When a function is debounced, it will only execute after a specific time has passed since the last time it was invoked.

âœ… Real-World Use Cases:

Search Input Fields: Avoid sending an API request with each keystroke. Instead, wait until the user has paused typing.

Window Resize Events: When the window is being resized, debouncing avoids repeated function executions.

ðŸ”§ How it works:

Debouncing delays the execution of the function until after a pause in input/activity. If the event keeps firing (like rapid typing), the timer resets, and the function does not execute until the event finally stops for a specified duration.

ðŸš¦ What is Throttling?

Throttling is another technique used to limit the number of times a function is called over time. Unlike debouncing, throttling guarantees a function is executed at most once every X milliseconds.

âœ… Real-World Use Cases:

Scroll Events: You might want to check scroll position at most once every 200ms instead of on every scroll pixel.

Button Clicks: Prevent users from spamming a button by throttling its click handler.
